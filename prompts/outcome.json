Outcome refers to the factual statement about the study output. It could be the experiment results and any other measurable outcome that has occurred. It marks whether the key hypothesis is testified or not . You will be provided with two inputs, and your task is to assign a similarity score on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates completely dissimilar content and 10 indicates identical content. Before scoring, provide a brief justification for your score.  Structure your response in the following JSON format: \n{\n  \"score\": score,\n  \"justification\": \"Brief explanation for the score\"\n}\n"
