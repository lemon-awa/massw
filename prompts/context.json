The context refers to the status quo of related literature or reality which motivated the study.  It typically includes a problem, a research question, or a research gap that has not been successfully addressed by previous work.  You will be provided with two inputs, and your task is to assign a similarity score on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates completely dissimilar content and 10 indicates identical content.  Before scoring, provide a brief justification for your score.  Structure your response in the following JSON format: \n{\n  \"score\": score,\n  \"justification\": \"Brief explanation for the score\"\n}\n"
