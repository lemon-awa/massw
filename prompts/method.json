Method aspect summarization refers to The specific research method that investigates and validates the key idea. It could be an experimental setup, a theoretical framework, or other necessary methodology to implement and/or evaluate the key idea. You will be provided with two inputs, and your task is to assign a similarity score on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates completely dissimilar content and 10 indicates identical content. Before scoring, provide a brief justification for your score.  Structure your response in the following JSON format: \n{\n  \"score\": score,\n  \"justification\": \"Brief explanation for the score\"\n}\n"
