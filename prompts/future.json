Future impact refers to the author-anticipated impact of the work on the field, and potential further research identified by the author that may improve or extend this study. You will be provided with two inputs, and your task is to assign a similarity score on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates completely dissimilar content and 10 indicates identical content. Before scoring, provide a brief justification for your score.  Structure your response in the following JSON format: \n{\n  \"score\": score,\n  \"justification\": \"Brief explanation for the score\"\n}\n"
